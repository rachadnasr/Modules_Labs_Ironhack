# Lab | Python + 

## Introduction

In to Pandas lessons, we learned about the dataframe calculations, how to work with them, and how to perform basic calculations with them.

The goal of this lab is to help you practice the concepts you learned in the lesson and provide you with some hands-on experience working with Pandas.

## Getting Started

In this lab you will be working on [main.ipynb](your-code/main.ipynb). To launch it, first navigate to the directory that contains `main.ipynb` in Terminal, then execute `jupyter notebook`. In the webpage that is automatically opened, click the `main.ipynb` link to launch it.

When you are on `main.ipynb`, read the instructions for each cell and provide your answers. Make sure to test your answers in each cell and save. Jupyter Notebook should automatically save your work progress. But it's a good idea to periodically save your work manually just in case.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
