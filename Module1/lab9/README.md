# Lab | Loops


## Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to work with loops. 
There 2 types of loops in Python, while and for. 
The while loop can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true. And the for loop is used for for iterating over a sequence.
## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `Lab_9 Loops` folder.
Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary. By the end of this lab, you will have learned about string manipulation.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
