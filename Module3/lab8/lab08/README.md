# Lab | Evaluation: Recall & Precision

## Introduction

In this lab you are going to compare how well some different types of classifiers perform on different evaluation metrics. 

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
